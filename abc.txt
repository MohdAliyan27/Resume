Today marks my last day at Tata Consultancy Services !! 5 years!! An unforgettable journey!! First job!! Last Day!!

It's said that love your job not your company but the emotional attachment with your first company is cherished at a different level.

Gratitude to #tcs for enriching 5.2 years of my life - with Great people, Friends, Opportunities, Failures, Moments, Experiences, Happiness and learning.

I'm a proud TCS'er and wherever I go I'll cherish the moments in TCS.


The time has come..!!

This is a matter of immense pleasure for me to share that I have joined Infosys as a Technology Analyst. I am very excited to learn and grow in this new role.
